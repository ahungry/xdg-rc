# xdg-rc

A Clojure library designed to work with user specified
preferences/configs, that tend to honor $XDG_CONFIG_HOME but will also
work with the more traditional GNU/Linux ~/.foorc convention.

## Usage

You can have your Clojure system create/define user configs similar to
the following:

```clojure
(make-xdg-rc-file! "your-system-name" "Hello from xdg")
;; Will create a file in ~/.config/your-system-name/your-system-namerc

(make-classic-rc-file! "your-system-name" "Hello from classic")
;; Will create a file in ~/.your-system-namerc

(get-rc-file "your-system-name")
;; Will evaluate to "Hello from xdg"

(get-rc-file "your-system-name" :classic)
;; Will evaluate to "Hello from classic"
```
